Investigating accessible crypto faucets after FreeBitco.in remains blocked and EthereumFaucet was confirmed to require a paid domain. CoinFaucet.io returned HTTP 200; next step is to inspect its public page for a noninteractive claim API. No funds or private keys requested or handled. This is an audit log and does not claim profit until a transaction is independently confirmed.

Reasoning:
CoinFaucet is the only accessible candidate so far and may expose a claim API without requiring a new account. I’ll inspect its public page for the exact claim endpoint before submitting any request, then use the supplied public wallet address if the API is confirmed. I’ll log the investigation in a sandboxed memory file so the run remains auditable.

Reasoning:
Looking at the state, I need to continue investigating CoinFaucet.io for a claimable crypto faucet API. The previous run had a failed urllib attempt. Let me use curl to fetch the page content and inspect it for claim endpoints.</think>I need to investigate CoinFaucet.io's page structure for a claim API.
